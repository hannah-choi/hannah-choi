### Hi there, I'm Hannah.

The world is divided into two types of people: those who run away saying they don’t know, and those who approach saying they don’t know. I've clearly been the latter. 
Transitioning from web design to development, I've continuously navigated through a sea of unknowns, fussing and figuring things out along the way.

* Software engineer in London
* I use: `TypeScript` `React` `Node.js` `Next.js`
* Currently learning `Python`
